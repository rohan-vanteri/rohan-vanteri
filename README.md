## 👨‍💻 Software Development Projects

-Data Structures and Algorithms Practice
  - [Practicing DS & Algos in Java](https://github.com/rohan-vanteri/Algorithims-Practice)

-Moore-Penrose Inverse
  - Worked with **Professor Sergey Nikitin** to develop an algorithm for calculating the pseudoinverse of specific matrices with **20–40% faster runtime** than the standard approach  
  - Implemented the algorithm in **[EditCalculateAndChart](https://github.com/mathhobbit/EditCalculateAndChart?tab=readme-ov-file)** inside **[Matrix.java](https://github.com/mathhobbit/EditCalculateAndChart/blob/master/src/org/ioblako/math/linearalgebra/Matrix.java)**
  - Now working to design and implement a neural network classifier with instantaneous learning abilities (Spring 2026)
